Task:
Analyze the juniper_canopy prototype for pre-deployment readiness. Based on DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md, identify:
1. Critical gaps preventing MVP deployment
2. Highest-priority enhancements from Phase 2 that are still pending
3. Testing gaps that could cause regressions
4. Any architectural, logical, or syntactical issues
5. Recommended priority order for implementation

Focus on items marked P1A-P1E in the roadmap, especially:
- Client-Side WebSocket (P1B)
- Training Controls (P1C)
- Comprehensive Testing (P1D)
- Configuration Improvements (P1E)

Provide specific recommendations for each area with file paths and implementation approach.
