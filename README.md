## Active Research Components

**juniper_cascor**:  Cascade Correlation Neural Network

- Reference implementation from foundational research (Fahlman & Lebiere, 1990)
- Designed for flexibility, modularity, and scalability
- Enables investigation of constructive learning algorithms

**juniper_canopy**:  Interactive Research Interface

- Research-driven monitoring and visualization environment
- Delivers novel observations through real-time network introspection
- Transforms metrics into insights, accelerating experimental iteration

## Research Philosophy

Juniper prioritizes **transparency over convenience** and **understanding over abstraction**.  By implementing algorithms from first principles, the platform provides increased visibility into network behavior, enabling a more rigorous and more controlled investigation of learning dynamics and architectural innovations.
