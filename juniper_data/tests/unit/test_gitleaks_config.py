"""Pin ``.gitleaks.toml``: the ruleset CI's Gitleaks step loads must not be empty.

Until 2026-10-25 the file held an ``[allowlist]`` and no ``[extend]`` table, and a gitleaks v8
config without ``[extend] useDefault = true`` loads ONLY its own ``[[rules]]`` -- of which it had
none. The Security Scans job's Gitleaks step therefore ran with zero rules and could not fail: a
fabricated GitHub token passed it while gitleaks' built-in config flags the same token (the
defect juniper-ml#2203 found and fixed there).

The structural tests read the config with ``tomllib``. The real-engine tests run the gitleaks
binary (``GITLEAKS_BIN``, else ``gitleaks`` on PATH) on a token ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME, so this file
holds no literal that gitleaks or GitHub push protection would flag. They skip without a binary,
except in ci.yml's Security Scans job, which runs this file with ``GITLEAKS_PARITY_REQUIRED=1``
after gitleaks-action, or on a pull request the ``Install Gitleaks`` step, has put the binary on
PATH: a check that could not run is not a pass.

The pull-request cases pin the scan's RANGE. gitleaks-action v3.0.0 lists a pull request's commits
with one unpaginated API call (30 per page, oldest first) and scans
``--no-merges --first-parent <first>^..<last>`` across that page, so it never reaches the 31st
commit, and, at any length, it drops every commit a merge brought into the branch (juniper-ml's
notes/JUNIPER_2026-11-06_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_CURSOR-FLOOD-4-DISPOSITION.md, §4, the juniper-data row).
ci.yml therefore skips the action on ``pull_request`` and runs two steps of its own: an install of
the same 8.24.3 engine, checked against the release's SHA-256, and a scan of ``base..head`` from the
event payload, with ``--remerge-diff`` so that what a two-parent merge commit itself changed (a
conflict resolution, a file added during the merge) is scanned too. git prints no such patch for an
octopus merge, so the scan refuses a range that holds one. It also hands the engine a ``git`` that
deletes the ``remerge ...`` notes git writes into a merge's file headers: gitleaks 8.24.3's patch
parser otherwise names such a finding ``b/<path>``, and when a note holds the word "commit" drops
the merge's SHA from it, so no commit-scoped ``.gitleaksignore`` entry can match it. The static
cases pin that wiring. The rehearsals run the scan step's own ``run:`` block under ``bash -e``, the
default shell for a step that names none, in a hermetic repository: with a stand-in ``gitleaks``
that records its argv and exits with the status under test, or that runs ``git log`` the way the
engine does, and with the real engine. The engine has to find a token in the 1st and the 35th
commit of a 35-commit range, one a merge brought in, and one that only a merge commit's own changes
hold, under the merge's SHA and the file's own path even when the conflict note says "commit", and
it has to pass a clean range whose BASE commit holds a token and a clean merge of the base branch
whose side holds one.

The conda cases pin the AND-scoped ``generic-api-key`` allowlist for conda build strings (the
recurring class: every conda-env refresh rewrites those lines under a commit no ``.gitleaksignore``
entry can name in advance). A build string in a conda file is allowlisted; the same line in any
other file still fires; and a real-looking value in a conda file still fires, both under
``generic-api-key`` (the allowlist's regex is half of the AND) and under any other rule (the
allowlist is on ``generic-api-key`` alone). The spec lines are assembled at runtime too: outside a
conda file a literal one is exactly what the rule flags.
